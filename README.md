# Simple [MLP - NeuralNetwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) Library For Microcontrollers 
Nothing "Import ant", just a simple library for implementing Neural-Networks(NNs) easily and effectively on any Arduino board and other microcontrollers.

## ```Summary```
| NN Functions | Input Type (x)|Output Type (Y) | Action |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| ```*FeedForword(X) ```| 1D Float Array| 1D Float Array| "Feeds" the NN with X-input values and returns Y-Output Values, If needed.|
| ```*BackProp(x) ```| 1D Float Array|1D Float Array| Tells to the NN if the outputs-Y were right/the-expected-X-inputs and then, teaches it.|
